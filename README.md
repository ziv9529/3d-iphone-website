# Why did I choose this project?

As part of a course I took from [JSM](https://www.jsmastery.pro/) I built Apple's website, fully designed by the course author

My goal was to experiment with the gsap and three js libraries which conveniently support animations and the use of 3D on my website

In addition, I learned something new while using a tool called Sentry which supports receiving metrics and data about users who will visit the site, helps with error handling and performance.

to run the project you can clone the repo by: `git clone https://github.com/ziv9529/3d-iphone-website.git`

then run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
